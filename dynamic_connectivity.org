#+TITLE: Dynamic Connectivity

- Course today discusses the union find problems

* Union-Find

** Dynamic Connectivity

Given a set of N objects

+ Union command: connect two objects
  + Find/connected query: is there a path connecting the two objects?

+ Algorithms provided today will not provide the path itself, but will discover if a given path exists

+ We assumed "is connected to" is an equivalence relation:
  + Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive

+ Connected components: maximal set of objects that are mutually connected (sets of objects where each object in a set is connected to another)
